# Circus of Plates - ONE PIECE Edition

Circus of Plates is a Java game developed as a final project for a university course.
This version of the game is inspired by the popular anime and manga series One Piece.

## Project Description:

As part of a game development project, I contributed to the creation of a single-player game. The objective of the game was to control a clown character who carried two stacks of plates. The gameplay involved catching falling objects, primarily colored plates, to score points. If the clown successfully collected three consecutive plates of the same color, they would disappear, and the player's score would increase. The game also included rules that determined the end of the game.

Tasks for the project were as follows
1. Implemented the game using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.
2. Created a clown character and programmed its controls to catch falling objects.
3. Developed a dynamic shape loading system for the falling objects, including plates and shapes.
4. Incorporated various design patterns such as Singleton, Factory, and Observer to enhance the game's functionality.
5. Ensured smooth interaction and gameplay experience by integrating the custom game engine.
6. Tested and debugged the game to identify and fix any issues or glitches.
7. Collaborated with team members to integrate different components of the game seamlessly.
8. Designed and implemented user interfaces for game menus and settings using appropriate graphics libraries.
9. Optimized the game's performance and memory usage for smooth gameplay on various devices.
10. Documented the project, including code comments and user instructions, for future reference and maintenance.
